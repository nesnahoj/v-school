Exercise - Hit List ($http)
27 MAY 2015 on Exercise, Angular, Week 8, Web Applications, Level 2
You have been hired by the Godfather to make an internal mafia hit list site. The Corleone family has been having a hard time keeping track of all the people they need to 'take care of ', and all the jobs that have already been successfully carried out. You have decided to use Angular to build this site because you want it to be professional (after all, this is the mafia), and Don Vito Corleone has put you on a deadline.

hit list

You will need to make a GET request to retrieve the data for this hit list, and you can do this with $http.get().

The data is located at this endpoint: http://mean.codingcamp.us:6543/hitlist.json

Make sure to do a good job on this one so that you don't end up on that list :)
