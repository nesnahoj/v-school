Warmup - Print Date
02 JUNE 2015 on JavaScript, Week 9, Warmup, Programming Principles, Level 1
Write a JavaScript program to display the current day and time. The format that prints to the console should look similar to this:

  Today is: Friday
  Current time is: 4:52:40 PM
All that matters is the end result. No matter what day you run this program, it should output the appropriate information. Do this in pure JavaScript.
