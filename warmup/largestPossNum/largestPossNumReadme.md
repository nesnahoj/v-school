//Warmup problem for today. Write a function that given a list of non negative integers, arranges them such that they form the largest possible number. For example, given [50, 2, 1, 9], the largest formed number is //95021. It's a bit of a brain teaser so try to solve it on your own but feel free to do some research if you get stuck.

//I would want to loop through an array of numbers and find the largest one, then itterate back through with a loop for the next, and so on.
